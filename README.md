## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a self-motivated **Front-End Developer** with over **1 year of hands-on experience** building sleek, responsive, and scalable web applications. My tech journey revolves around creating seamless user experiences using **React.js**, **Next.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**, while also diving into powerful backend tools like **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.

I thrive on continuous learning and love working on real-time, animated, and interactive experiences using tools like **WebSocket**, **DnD Kit**, and **Framer Motion**.

> 💡 *"Code is not just what I do — it's how I express creativity and solve real-world problems."*
